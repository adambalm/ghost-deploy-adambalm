## üì¶ Notable Automation & Services

- **Render Deployment**:  
  - Triggered via `deploy.yml` on pushes to `main` that affect `content/themes/**`  
  - Uses Dockerfile ‚Üí `entrypoint.sh` ‚Üí dynamic Ghost runtime injection

- **Theme Injection Path**:  
  - Only `content/themes/adambalm-theme` is injected  
  - Former `theme/` path has been removed (see commit history)

- **n8n Integration**:  
  - Cloud-based; workflow `content-pipeline-substack` is paused  
  - Supports webhook-based ingestion, currently under revision
